   * @apiDeprecated This description is deprecated and only for informational,
   * "historic" purposes. See <a
   * href="#api-SliceConfiguration-ApplySliceConfiguration">here instead</a>.
   *
   * @apiParam (URL parameter) {Number} [id=-1] The ID of the agent for which
   * to change the slice configuration. This can be one of the following: -1
   * (last added agent), the eNB ID (in hex or decimal) or the internal agent
   * ID which can be obtained through a `stats` call. Numbers smaller than 1000
   * are parsed as the agent ID.
   *
   * @apiParam (JSON parameters) {Boolean} [intrasliceShareActive] The
   * activation status of the intra-slice sharing phase. If active, RBs that
   * are available after the first intra-slice allocation will be allocated to
   * UEs belonging to the same slice that need it.
   * @apiParam (JSON parameters) {Boolean} [intersliceShareActive] The
   * activation status of the inter-slice multiplexing phase. If active, RBs
   * that are available after the allocation of a slice, will be allocated to
   * UEs belonging to the other slices that need it. Isolated slices are always
   * ignored in this phase.
   * @apiParam (JSON parameters) {Object[]} [dl] A list of DL slice
   * configuration objects. For its parameters, see the parameters in the `JSON
   * DL part parameters` table below.
   * @apiParam (JSON parameters) {Object[]} [ul] A list of UL slice
   * configuration objects. For its parameters, see the parameters in the `JSON
   * UL part parameters` table below.
   *
   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {Number{0-255}} id The unique ID of
   * the addressed DL slice.
   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {String="xMBB","URLLC","mMTC","xMTC","Other"} [label]

   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {Number{1-100}} [percentage] The
   * number of resource blocks that this slice is allowed to use, as a fraction
   * of the whole bandwidth. Please note that the sum of all slices is not
   * allowed to exceed 100.
   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {Boolean} [isolation] Whether this
   * slice is isolated with regard to others. Refer to the
   * `intersliceShareActive` to see the interaction with this parameter. If a
   * slice is not isolated, unused RBs will be shared with other slices in the
   * inter-slice multiplexing phase.
   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {Number{0-20}} [priority] The priority
   * of the slice when scheduling in the interslice multiplexing stage
   * allocating in a greedy manner. Higher priority means preferential
   * scheduling.
   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {Number{0-24}} [positionLow] When
   * positioning a slice in the frequency plane, this parameter marks the lower
   * end (inclusive, i.e. `posL <= RB`).  Expressed in *RBG*. Must be lower
   * than `positionHigh`. During the multiplexing phase, other RBs could be
   * chosen, too. See `intersliceShareActive` for more information.
   * @apiParam (JSON DL part parameters) {Number{1-25}} [positionHigh] When
   * positioning a slice in the frequency plane, this parameter marks the high
   * end (inclusive, i.e. `RB <= posH`).  Expressed in *RBG*. Must be higher
   * than `positionLow`. During the multiplexing phase, other RBs could be
   * chosen, too. See `intersliceShareActive` for more information.

   * * `"CR_ROUND"`: Highest HARQ first.
   * * `"CR_SRB12"`: Highest SRB1+2 first.
   * * `"CR_HOL"`:   Highest HOL first.
   * * `"CR_LC"`:    Highest RLC buffer first.
   * * `"CR_CQI"`:   Highest CQI first.

   * the addressed UL slice.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {String="xMBB","URLLC","mMTC","xMTC","Other"} [label]
   * A descriptive label for this slice. It has currently no impact on the
   * slice itself but might be extended to provide appropriate default values
   * in the future.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {Number{1-100}} [percentage] The
   * number of resource blocks that this slice is allowed to use, as a fraction
   * of the whole bandwidth. Please note that the sum of all slices is not
   * allowed to exceed 100.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {Boolean} [isolation] Whether this
   * slice is isolated with regard to others. Refer to the
   * `intersliceShareActive` to see the interaction with this parameter. If a
   * slice is not isolated, unused RBs will be shared with other slices in the
   * inter-slice multiplexing phase.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {Number{0..20}} [priority] The
   * priority of the slice when scheduling in the interslice multiplexing stage
   * allocating in a greedy manner. Higher priority means preferential
   * scheduling.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {Number{0-$(bandwidth RB-1)}} [firstRb] Used to
   * position a UL slice together with the percentage in the frequency plane.
   * This parameter should be used to isolate slices in the UL and is subject
   * to admission control like percentage: it is checked that no UL slice
   * overlaps with any other, starting at `firstRb`
   * and expanding `percentage` * bandwidth RB. This paramater is in *RB*,
   * unlike the `positionLow` and `positionHigh` parameters in the UL.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {Number{0-20}} [maxmcs] The maximum
   * MCS that this slice is allowed to use.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {String="POLU_FAIR","POLU_GREEDY"} [accounting]

   * `sorting` parameter.
   * @apiParam (JSON UL part parameters) {String="schedule_ulsch_rnti"} [schedulerName]
   * The name of the scheduler to be loaded. Can not be changed currently.
   *
   * @apiDescription This description is out-dated and a new format has been
   * adopted. In the new endpoint, a number of the old parameters are not
   * available anymore, while new ones have been added. In particular, the new
   * system is capable of supporting arbitrary slice algorithms (they will be
   * added gradually over time), and the actual scheduling algorithm can be
   * set per slice.  On the other hand, the following parameters cannot be set
   * anymore or have changed:
   *
   * * `intersliceShareActive`: governed whether slices shared resources. Now
   * depends on the slice algorithm.
   * * `intrasliceShareActive`: governed whether user scheduling shared
   * resources. Now depends on the user scheduling algorithm.
   * * `percentage`: static slicing has a minimum granularity of a RBG (DL)/RB
   * (UL). As such, a percentage was misleading, and the lower/upper bounds of a
   * slice have to be set manually.
   * * `isolation`: defined whether this slices shares resources. Now depends
   * on the slice algorithm.
   * * `priority`: defined the priority of a slice during slice resource
   * sharing. Now depends on the slice algorithm.
   * * `maxmcs`: defined a maximum MCS. Now depends on the user scheduler.
   * Different schedulers might be defined that would apply a maximum MCS.
   * * `sorting`: sorting of users within a slice. Now depends on the user
   * scheduler.
   * * `accounting`: how resources are attributed to users. `POL_FAIR` is
   * closest to `round_robin_dl`, `POL_GREEDY` is closest to
   * `maximum_throughput_wbcqi_dl` together with `CR_LC` sorting.
   * * `firstRb`: a starting position of a slice in UL. Has been superseded
   * by `posLow`. a call and sufficient time to verify the actions have been taken.
   *
   * Original description: This API endpoint posts a new slice configuration to an
   * underlying agent, specified as a JSON file with the format of the
   * `sliceConfig` as contained in the `cellConfig` of an agent configuration
   * (for a description of the parameters, see below).  It can be used to
   * create arbitrary slices with an arbitrary ID  or to change slices by
   * specifying an ID for an existing slice. In the request, a slice ID must
   * present. All other values will be copied from slice ID 0 if they are not
   * present.  The caller should take care that the sum of slice percentages
   * (i.e. of all present and added slices) should not exceed 100 and no UL
   * slices overlap (a UL slice starts at `firstRb` and extends over
   * `percentage` * bandwidth RBs. The `stats` call should always be used
   * after triggering this endpoint and sufficient time to verify the actions
   * have been taken.

   * @apiDescription This API endpoint posts a new slice configuration to an

   * `sliceConfig` as contained in the `cellConfig` of an agent configuration
   * (for a description of the parameters, see below), or the scheduler to use
   * if no slicing algorithm is chosen (`None`).  It can be used to
   * create arbitrary slices with an arbitrary ID or to change slices by
   * specifying an ID for an existing slice. In the request, a slice ID must be
   * present, as well as the slice parameters. The label is optional, and if no
   * scheduler is given, the scheduler that was active when enabling slicing
   * will be used. The `stats` call should always be used after triggering this
   * endpoint and sufficient time to verify the actions have been taken. Note
   * that the `scheduler` (within `dl`/`ul`) and the `slices` parameters are
   * mutually exclusive, since the first only applies for no slicing algorithm
   * (`None`), whereas the latter only applies if a slicing algorithm has been
   * chosen.
   *
   * This API call has changed as of July 2020. For a description of how the
   * old parameters can be reproduced in the new call, see <a
   * href="#api-SliceConfiguration-DeprApplySliceConfiguration">Deprecated
   * Slice Configuration</a>
   *
   * Remarks on the `Static` slicing algorithm: this algorithm does not provide
   * any sharing. Note that `posLow`/`posHigh` are in terms of resource block
   * groups (RBG) in DL and resource blocks (RB) in UL. Furthermore, it is not
   * checked that the channel bandwidth can actually accommodate this slice
   * (`posLow=100` and `posHigh=110` are a valid entry, but they will never
   * work, since LTE has a maximum bandwidth of 100RBs). Please refer to the
   * `stats` call to check the amount of resource blocks as well as the
   * resource block group size which will tell the applicable RB/RBG settings.
   * Please also note that OAI reserves the first and last 1, 2, or 3 RBs (for
   * bandwidths 25, 50, or 100RBs, respectively) for PUCCH, meaning that these
   * first/last RBs should be spared out/they won't be given to the slice.
   * Also, the minimum RB size in UL is 3!
   *
   * Remarks on the `NVS` slicing algorithm: it is implemented following the
   * <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1109/tnet.2011.2179063">NVS paper</a>. The
   * current implementation only supports DL.
   *
   * Remarks on the `SCN19` slicing algorithm: it is implemented following a
   * <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013258">paper
   * from Schmidt et al.</a> It has a special "on-demand" slice type to
   * preferentially schedule users in order to assure low scheduling latency
   * while maximising the multiplexing gain (e.g., unlike static slice
   * allocation).
